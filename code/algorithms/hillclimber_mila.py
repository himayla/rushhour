1. Get a random board from the path that's at least 25 moves away from the final board. 
2. Choose another board between 15 and 25 further down the path. 
3. Do a breath first algorithms on the first chosen board and save the steps in a dictionary. 
4. When the final board is found:
5. If the path to the final board is smaller than the path that was given originally to the algorithm.
