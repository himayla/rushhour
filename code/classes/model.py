"""
This file includes the model that is used in all algorithms. 
By making the grid into a model it is easier and faster to run algorithms. 
The actions that can be performed within this model are divided into general abilities and algorithm abilities.
 
The general abilities include:
- Getting car id's from a board.
- Printing a specific board from a grid.
- Creating a csv file to show the car that moves and the relative move that it makes.

The algorithms abilities include: 
- Getting a list of all the empty spaces that exist on the board of the grid.
- Showing the cars in four directions (upper, lower, left, right) relative to a specific empty space. 
- Showing a list of cars that can move to a specific empty space.
- Moving a chosen car to a chosen empty space.
- Showing which location the red car needs to be in to qualify the algorithm as "done".
